# Cognitive Biases

Our brains take shortcuts that can lead to errors in thinking. Understanding these biases helps us think more clearly.

## What are Cognitive Biases?

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rational judgment. They're mental shortcuts that sometimes mislead us.

## Common Biases

**Confirmation Bias**
We tend to seek information that confirms what we already believe and ignore contradictory evidence.

*Example: Only reading news sources that align with your political views.*

**Anchoring Bias**
We rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive.

*Example: A $100 shirt seems cheap if you first saw one priced at $500.*

**Availability Heuristic**
We judge probability by how easily examples come to mind.

*Example: Fearing plane crashes more than car accidents, even though cars are statistically more dangerous.*

**Bandwagon Effect**
We tend to believe things because many other people believe them.

*Example: Buying a product because it's popular, not because it's best for your needs.*

## Overcoming Biases

1. Be aware they exist
2. Actively seek opposing viewpoints
3. Ask "What evidence would change my mind?"
4. Slow down important decisions
5. Consider base rates and statistics
