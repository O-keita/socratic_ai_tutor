# Variables and Data

Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming. They let us store and work with information.

## What is a Variable?

Think of a variable as a labeled box where you can store things. The label is the variable's name, and the contents are its value.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```

## Types of Data

Different boxes hold different types of things:

**Strings** - Text in quotes
```python
greeting = "Hello"
```

**Integers** - Whole numbers
```python
count = 42
```

**Floats** - Decimal numbers
```python
price = 19.99
```

**Booleans** - True or False
```python
is_active = True
```

## Using Variables

Once you store something in a variable, you can use it:

```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name)  # Outputs: Hello, Alice

age = 25
next_year = age + 1  # next_year is now 26
```

## Naming Variables

Good variable names are:
- Descriptive: `user_age` not `x`
- Lowercase with underscores: `total_score`
- Not starting with numbers: `score1` ✓, `1score` ✗
