# If Statements

Programs need to make decisions. If statements let your code choose different paths based on conditions.

## The Basic If

```python
temperature = 30

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot outside!")
```

The code inside the `if` block only runs when the condition is True.

## If-Else

What if we want to do something different when the condition is False?

```python
temperature = 15

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot outside!")
else:
    print("It's not too hot.")
```

## Multiple Conditions with Elif

```python
temperature = 15

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's very hot!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's warm.")
elif temperature > 10:
    print("It's cool.")
else:
    print("It's cold!")
```

## Comparison Operators

- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal
- `<=` less than or equal
- `==` equal to (note: two equals signs!)
- `!=` not equal to

## Important: Indentation

Notice the spaces before `print()`? In Python, indentation matters! It tells Python which code belongs inside the if statement.
