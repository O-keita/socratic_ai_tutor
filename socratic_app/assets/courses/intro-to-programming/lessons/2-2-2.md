# While Loops

While loops repeat as long as a condition is True. Use them when you don't know how many repetitions you'll need.

## Basic While Loop

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Important: Avoid Infinite Loops!

If the condition never becomes False, the loop runs forever:

```python
# DON'T DO THIS - infinite loop!
while True:
    print("This never stops!")
```

Always make sure your loop has a way to end.

## Practical Example: User Input

```python
password = ""

while password != "secret123":
    password = input("Enter password: ")

print("Access granted!")
```

## Break and Continue

**break** - Exit the loop immediately:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Stop when i is 5
    print(i)
```

**continue** - Skip to next iteration:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue  # Skip 2
    print(i)
```

## When to Use Which?

- **For loop**: When you know the number of iterations
- **While loop**: When you need to loop until a condition changes
