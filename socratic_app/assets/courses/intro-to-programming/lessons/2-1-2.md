# Logical Operators

Sometimes you need to check multiple conditions at once. Logical operators help combine conditions.

## AND Operator

Both conditions must be True:

```python
age = 25
has_license = True

if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive!")
```

## OR Operator

At least one condition must be True:

```python
day = "Saturday"

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
```

## NOT Operator

Reverses a boolean:

```python
is_raining = False

if not is_raining:
    print("No umbrella needed!")
```

## Combining Operators

You can combine multiple operators:

```python
temperature = 22
is_sunny = True

if temperature > 20 and temperature < 30 and is_sunny:
    print("Perfect weather for a walk!")
```

## Truth Tables

Understanding how these work:

| A | B | A and B | A or B |
|---|---|---------|--------|
| T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | T |
| F | T | F | T |
| F | F | F | F |
