# Hello, World!

Every programmer's journey begins with the same tradition: writing a program that displays "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## Why "Hello, World"?

This simple program has been the first step for millions of programmers since 1978. It's a way to:
- Verify your programming environment works
- Learn the basic syntax of a language
- Celebrate your first working program!

## In Python

Here's how you write Hello World in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

That's it! Just one line. The `print()` function displays text on the screen.

## Breaking It Down

- `print` - A built-in function that outputs text
- `(` and `)` - Parentheses that contain what we want to print
- `"Hello, World!"` - The text we want to display (called a "string")

## Try It Yourself

Think about what would happen if you wrote:
- `print("Your name here")`
- `print(Hello World)` (without quotes)
- `print("Hello, " + "World!")`

What do you predict each would do?
