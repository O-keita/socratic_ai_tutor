# What is a Program?

Now that we understand computers, let's explore what programs are.

## Programs are Instructions

A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Just like a recipe tells you how to cook a meal, a program tells a computer how to complete a task.

## Example: Making a Sandwich

If you were to write instructions for making a sandwich, they might look like:

1. Get two slices of bread
2. Open the peanut butter jar
3. Use a knife to spread peanut butter on one slice
4. Open the jelly jar
5. Spread jelly on the other slice
6. Put the two slices together

Notice how specific these instructions need to be. Computers need even MORE specific instructions!

## Why Precision Matters

Computers do exactly what you tell them - nothing more, nothing less. If your instructions are unclear or missing steps, the computer won't "figure it out" like a human might.

## Programming Languages

We write programs using programming languages. These are special languages designed to give precise instructions to computers. Examples include:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++

Each language has its own rules and syntax, but they all serve the same purpose: communicating with computers.
