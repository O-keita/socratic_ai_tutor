# For Loops

Loops let you repeat code multiple times. For loops are great when you know how many times you want to repeat.

## Basic For Loop

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Understanding range()

`range(5)` creates numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (not including 5)

You can customize it:
- `range(1, 6)` → 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- `range(0, 10, 2)` → 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (counting by 2)

## Looping Through Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")
```

Output:
```
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

## Practical Example

```python
# Calculate sum of numbers 1 to 10
total = 0

for number in range(1, 11):
    total = total + number

print(f"The sum is {total}")  # Output: The sum is 55
```

## Nested Loops

Loops inside loops:

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```
