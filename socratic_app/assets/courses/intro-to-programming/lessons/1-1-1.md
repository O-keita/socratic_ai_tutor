# Understanding Computers

Computers are everywhere in our modern world. But what exactly is a computer, and how does it work?

## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that processes information. Think of it as a very fast calculator that can also store information and follow instructions.

## Key Components

**Hardware** - The physical parts you can touch:
- CPU (Central Processing Unit) - The "brain"
- Memory (RAM) - Short-term storage
- Storage (Hard Drive/SSD) - Long-term storage
- Input devices (keyboard, mouse)
- Output devices (monitor, speakers)

**Software** - The programs and instructions:
- Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Applications (browsers, games, editors)

## How Computers Process Information

Computers work with binary - just 0s and 1s. Everything you see on screen, every song you hear, is ultimately represented as patterns of these two digits.

Think about it: How might you represent different things using only "on" and "off" signals?
